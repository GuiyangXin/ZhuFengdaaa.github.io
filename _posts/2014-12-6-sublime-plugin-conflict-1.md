title: plugin conflict in sublime (1)
---

*the first plugin conflict in sublime I found*

between Colorpicker and Css_comb, both Key-bindings are "ctrl+shift+c"  

![modify](/images/conflict-1.jpg "modify")

if you want to use Css_comb  by pressing "ctrl+shift+c", just leave it alone;
else if you want to use Colorpicker with key binding ,comment the line out;
