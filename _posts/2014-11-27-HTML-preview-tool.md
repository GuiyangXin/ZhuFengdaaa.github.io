title: create a preview of HTML files with sumblime
---

As a newer in HTML, I felt tired to view what I had written in HTML. As most freshmen, I use`ctrl+S` to *Save file*, and find the path where the file is, and then open it with explorer.
	This week, I found a convient way to preview it just press `Ctrl+B`

##Let's get Start

###STEP 1

![STEP1](/images/build-tool-step1.jpg "Step 1")
 *Tools->Build System->New Build System*

###STEP 2

![STEP2](/images/build-tool-step2.jpg "Step 2")
 *Use windows command to open this file with default explorer*

###STEP 3

![STEP3](/images/build-tool-step3.jpg "Step 3")
 *Save it in Package->User directory and switch the default build system*

=================================================>

###WOW! Now you can preview it by pressing `Ctrl+B`  

##Hint

**you cannot preview file whose filename is not encoded in ascii** , which will cause a build problem
