### Why I choose Jekyll?
1. Jekyll is just static web pages. No database, so it is  **faster and lighter**.
2. Also because it is a static web site. It's more **secure**. We don't need to worry about somebody may hack into the database and do something dangerous.
3. Because we don't have database, It reduce our manipulation. We don't bother to configure our database. All we need to do is dealing with our front-end text and script.
4. We don't have to pay for the VPS, cutting down our cost. We can host our page freely on the Github. Besides, you can get a costomed URL, username.github.io, *Pretty Cool!*
5. GitHub also provides automatic **version control** of my blog. We will not lose anything we had written.
6. It's *"Blog aware"*. What does this mean, exactly? Well, to short, it means that blogging is baked into Jekyll's functionally. Compared to the hassle of configuring and maintaining databases and web-based CMS systems, this will be a welcome alternative!
7.  Markdown ready! Unlike other Writing tools like WordPress, we will never striggling with templates. We can writing our code just like coding. **"Amazing Creation"**
8.  Development locally is much simpler. We can install jekyll locally.
