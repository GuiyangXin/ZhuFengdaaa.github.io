Jekyll is a *simple, blog-aware*, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through **Markdown** (or **Textile**) and **Liquid** converters, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind **GitHub Pages**, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.

##default framework
There are lots of frameworks and themes online.
Each “theme” contains *_layouts, _includes, assets*, and sample pages to get you started. For the most part they share a lot of similarities (especially in _config.yml), which should make switching and updating easier.
